# Project for CIS 350

### Description:

The project is about a suite of board games: the similarity between the games is that they are all played in some kind of grid board.

### Games:

- Checkers
- Memory
- Sudoku
- Minesweeper

Along with that, the final product will be comprised of a graphical user interface where the user can select the game and play.

As an optional challenge, the code will be converted to a Java applet and embedded in a HTML file, thus creating a website where it is possible to play these games.

### Division of work:

| Code | # of Players | Programmer | Contributor |
|------|-----|-----|-----|
| Checkers | Two Players | [Cole Sellers](https://github.com/Csellers15) | None |
| Memory | Two Players | [Gionata Bonazzi](https://github.com/GionataB) | None |
| Sudoku | Single Player | [Juan Tafarello Fidalgo](https://github.com/juantafarello) | None |
| Minesweeper | Single Player | [Rosa Fleming](https://github.com/rosafleming) | None |
| Interface | None | [Brendan Cronan](https://github.com/brendan-cronan) | None |

### Workflow:

| | Week(s) | Description | Completed On |
|-----|---------|-------------|--------- |
| Interface | 2/5 - 2/12 | Declare the methods you think you'll need on a Java Interface file and provide Javadoc comments | 2/12 (Juan's and Rosa's part missing)|
| Project Design | 2/12 - 2/19 | We should look at the interfaces and see if we can merge similar methods to prevent repeating code | - |
| Implementation | 2/19 - 3/5 | Write the Java classes for your code. Your code should compile without errors by 3/5. This will be the code of our first release | - |
| Comments | 3/5 - 3/9 | Finish writing Javadoc comments for all your classes. Make sure they follow the GVSU [Java Coding Style](http://www.cis.gvsu.edu/java-coding-style-guide/)| - |
| Testing | 3/9 - 3/16 | Test the code using JUnit classes| - |
| Expand | TBD - TBD | Implement new ideas and QoL changes to the program. Example: make it fancier, faster, more options, difficulty level etc... | - |
| Web App | TBD - TBD | Embed the Java code in a website | - |

### Communication

To easily share code, ideas and links, we will make use of a [slack channel](
