# Project for CIS 350

### Description:

The project is about a suite of board games: the similarity between the games is that they are all played in some kind of grid board.

### Games:

- Checkers
- Memory
- Sudoku
- Minesweeper

Along with that, the final product will be comprised of a graphical user interface where the user can select the game and play.

As an optional challenge, the code will be converted to a Java applet and embedded in a HTML file, thus creating a website where it is possible to play these games.

### Workflow:

| | Week(s) | Description | Completed On |
|-----|---------|-------------|--------- |
| Think about what to do moving forward | 3/29-4/3 | Discuss as a group what we need to change using feedback from first delieverable | 4/3|
| Project Design | 4/3-4/6 | Design a plan for how to create a more efficient checkers game and begin writing out the outline of classes we will use | 4/6 |
| Implementation | 4/6-4/18 | Write the Java classes for your code. Your code should compile without errors by 3/5. This will be the code of our first release | 4/15 |
| GUI | 4/6-4/12 | Create the GUI for the Checkers game. This will have a concurrent timeline as the Implementation| 4/16 |
| Comments | 4/18-4/20 | Finish writing Javadoc comments for all your classes. Make sure they follow the GVSU [Java Coding Style](http://www.cis.gvsu.edu/java-coding-style-guide/)| 4/19 |
| Testing | 4/18-4/20 | Test the code using JUnit classes| 4/20 |

### Communication

To easily share code, ideas and links, we will make use of a [slack channel](
