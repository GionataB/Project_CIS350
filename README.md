# Project for CIS 350

### Description:

The project is about a suite of board games: the similarity between the games is that they are all played in some king of grid board.

### Games:

- Checkers
- Sudoku
- Minesweeper

Along with that, the final product will be comprised of a graphical user interface where the user can select the game and play.

The final product will have statistics about the games and the players, as well as a functionality to save or load a game, and create a leaderboard that lists the ten highest scores obtained in the games.

We are still discussing the possibility to save and load a specific player.

| 6 | Code coverage | 3/7 - 3/11 | Use ElcEmma to test code coverage of checkers and minesweeper | 3/11 |
| 7 | Sudoku | 3/7 - 3/12 | Complete the Sudoku game for the second deliverable, no GUI yet | - |
| 8 | Refactor checkers and minesweeper | 3/12 - 3/19 | Change the code for the two games in order to have some objects in common. The parent classes are provided | - |
| 9 | Complete GUI | 3/12 - 3/26 | Make a unified GUI for all games. | - |
| 10| Testing | 3/19 - TBD | Test the code using JUnit classes| - |
