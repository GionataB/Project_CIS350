# Project_CIS350

### Description:

The project is about a suite of board games: the similarity between the games is that they are all played in some king of grid board.

### Games:

- Checkers
- Memory
- Sudoku
- Minesweeper

Along with that, the final product will be comprised of a graphical user interface where the user can select the game and play.

As an optional challenge, the code will be converted to a Java applet and embedded in a HTML file, thus creating a website where it is possible to play these games.
